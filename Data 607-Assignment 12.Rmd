For this assignment, you should take information from a relational database and migrate it to a NoSQL database of your own choosing. For the relational database, you might use the flights database, the tb database, the “data skills” database your team created for Project 3, or another database of your own choosing or creation. For the NoSQL database, you may use MongoDB (which we introduced in week 7), Neo4j, or another NoSQL database of your choosing.

Your migration process needs to be reproducible. R code is encouraged, but not required. You should also briefly describe the advantages and disadvantages of storing the data in a relational database vs. your NoSQL database.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Step 1: Load Packages

I decided on migrating the flights database, specifically the flights and airports tables, from SQL to Neo4j. We first have to load the necessary packages to connect the databases to R. To get the RNeo4j package, I downloaded it from Neo4j Github here: https://github.com/nicolewhite/RNeo4j
```{r load packages}
#load mySQL packages to connect to SQL db
library(RMySQL)
library(DBI)

#download and load the RNeo4j package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("nicolewhite/RNeo4j")
library(RNeo4j)
```

##Step 2: SQL data export
After connecting to the SQL database, I then used a select statement to pull out the ALL data for the airports and flights tables and added them to data frames inside R. I also did a data dimension to check to ensure the data prior to import matched the exported version in R.
```{r SQL}
#connect to SQL database
flights_db <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user='root', password='HIDDEN', dbname='flights', host='127.0.0.1')

#count number of rows/columns in airport/flights tables (airport: 4x3, flights: 24x7)
air_rcount<-dbGetQuery(flights_db,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM airports")
air_rcount

air_ccount<-dbGetQuery(flights_db,"SELECT COUNT(*)FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE table_name = 'airports'")
air_ccount

flight_rcount<-dbGetQuery(flights_db,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights")
flight_rcount

flight_ccount<-dbGetQuery(flights_db,"SELECT COUNT(*)FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE table_name = 'flights'")
flight_ccount

#import all data from the airports and flights tables 
airports <- dbGetQuery(flights_db, "SELECT * FROM airports")
flights <- dbGetQuery(flights_db, "SELECT * FROM flights")

#view the imported data
View(airports)
View(flights)

#check airports/flights data frame dimensions to see if they match the SQL tables (they match!)
dim(airports)
dim(flights)
```

##Step 3: Neo4j data import
After connecting to the Neo4j database, I cleared any exisiting graphs, created queries on both the airports/flights to create nodes and then created relationships by matching the aiport lables to the departure/arrival airports in flights. Once completed, we see that 24 flight nodes and 4 airport nodes with 48 relationships were created which makes sense because each flight (24) has a departue and arrival (24 X 2 = 48).
```{r Neo4j}
#create the connection from Neo4J to R 
graph <- startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/", username = "data607", password = "HIDDEN")

#clear exisiting graphs 
clear(graph, input = FALSE)

#create the Neo4j query, first creating the airport nodes
queryA <- "MERGE (a1:Airport {label:{label}, city:{city}, state:{state}})"

#creat the transaction in Neo4j
trA <- newTransaction(graph)

#loop through airports, adding in the node names for label, city and state
for (i in 1:nrow(airports)){
  appendCypher(trA,
               queryA,
               label = airports[i,]$label,
               city = airports[i,]$city,
               state = airports[i,]$state)
}

commit(trA)

#create flight nodes, then match the flight depart/arrive nodes w/ airport labels and create the relationship w/ airport departure (a) and matching flight (n) to arrival aiport (c)

queryF <- "MERGE (n:Flight {flight:{flight}, airline:{airline}, capacity:{capacity}})
WITH n MATCH (a:Airport {label:{depart}}), (c:Airport {label:{arrive}}) CREATE (a) -[de:DEPART {takeoff:{takeoff}}]-> (n) -[ar:ARRIVE {landing:{landing}}]-> (c)
"

trF <- newTransaction(graph)

for (i in 1:nrow(flights)){
  appendCypher(trF,
               queryF,
               flight = flights[i,]$flight,
               airline = flights[i,]$airline,
               capacity = flights[i,]$capacity,
               takeoff = flights[i,]$takeoff,
               landing = flights[i,]$landing,
               depart = flights[i,]$depart ,
               arrive = flights[i,]$arrive)
}

commit(trF)

#view the relationship by using the summary function
summary(graph)

#Open the graph in the browser the use code to view: match (n) return n
browse(graph, viewer = FALSE)

##Analysis: 

We can see that the least amount of flights are between the PIT and ATL aiports, with only 2 flight nodes in between them. There an equal amount of flights between DTW-PIT, DTW-BOS, BOS-PIT and ATL-DTW, with 6 flight nodes. DTW looks to be the busiest airports as it is connected to 18 flight nodes and ATL is the least busiest with only 12 flight nodes. 

##Pros/Cons
SQL Pros:

- highly suitable for relational databases
- has a predefined schema 
- fast in retrieving database records 
- single standardized language across different RDBMS

SQL Cons:
- interfacing is complex
- SQL is an object that occupies space
- big data scaling requires increased hardware which is costly

NoSQL Pros:
- handles big data well
- high level of flexibility with data models
- low-cost database 
- Easier and low-cost scalability

NoSQL Cons:
- less community support
- Lacks standardization, which can create issues during migration
- relaxed ACID properties which can effect the consistency in data
